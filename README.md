# Movie-Shopper

The application will allow users to browse/search a catalog of movies, add movies in a particular format (DVD or Blu-ray) to a shopping cart, adjust quantities, and remove items from that cart. 

This website uses the javascript libraries React to render movie data without refershing the page and Redux to store a shared state between the different components of the website (homepage, movie browse/search page, cart page).
